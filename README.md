### Annualized Rate of Return Calculation Code

### Notes:

1. Annualized Rate of Return (AROR) is based on __cash deposit dates__ and __cash deposit values__, relative to your current total Portfolio value
2. That is, AROR is calculated relative to the moment that cash is deposited (as opposed to "waiting" until the cash is used)
3. This correctly accounts for the time-value of cash balances. 
4. Assumes FIFO for stock transactions
